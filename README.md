# ProjectCSharp


This is a project in C# that me and my friend made on our second year of college.It's a simple application for managing 
host units, where someone can add their units for renting, and other people can book dates to rent them.


It has nice functionalities, such as searching units according to specific parameters, admin function for monitoring all the units, hosts, and clients and much more.
